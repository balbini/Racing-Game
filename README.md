# Racing-Game
My version of a racing game. Racing two Flash's together, around the world.

# Technologies Used
jQuery, HTML, CSS

# Code I'm Proud Of
playerOne ++;
$(".flash-run").animate({left:"+=9.9%"}, 0100)
if (playerOne > finish){
  $("h1").text("Barry Allen is the fastest man alive!")

I was able to get this animate function to work fairly early in this process. I am
proud of it because it was one of the first times I was able to get a difficult function to work
without asking for help. Though I did have to get clarification on how bring it to other areas
correctly. Being able to do something using my own knowledge and skills felt awesome.
